# About this Repository
This repo exists for purposes of understanding and researching how to work with older projects. The original Fabrikam Fiber sample application was made available on CodePlex and can be found in their archive.

This is the same sample project that you can find in the various versions of Brian Keller's VM. It was designed to be imperfect (i.e. contains bugs and surprises) allowing you to teach or tell a rich ALM story. This version was originally released as a VS2013 solution and the connection strings have been updated to `Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB` to work with SQL Server Express 2019.

# Background

Fabrikam Fiber is a fictional company that provides cable television and related services to the United States. They are growing rapidly and have embraced the *latest* Microsoft technologies in order to scale their customer-facing web site. This will allow the end users to create/manage tickets and track technicians in a self-service way. There is also an on-premises ASP.NET MVC application for their customer service representatives to administer customer orders.
